      <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>ItÂ´s a vertical board with 42 windows distributed in 6 rows and 7 columns.
        Both players have a set of 21 pieces; each with a different color.
        The board is empty at the start of the game.</p>
      <h2>Objective:</h2>
      <p>The aim for both players is to make a straight line of four own pieces; the line can be vertical,
         horizontal or diagonal.</p>
      <h2>How the game goes on:</h2>
      <p>Before starting, players decide randomly which of them will be the
        beginner; moves are made alternatively, one by turn. Moves entails
        in placing new pieces on the board; pieces slide downwards from
        upper holes, falling down to the last row or piling up on the last
        piece introduced in the same column. The winner is the first player who
        gets a straight line made with four own pieces and no gaps between them.</p>
