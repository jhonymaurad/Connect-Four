## LOG:
Thursday October 25: Finish all game logic for win conditions. Link javascript with user interface. Changed game theme from Connect Four to Link Four(The legend of Zelda).

Major struggles so far: Functions for win conditions, especially with the functions to check diagonally. Also linking user interface with javascript still not clear.

```
function topRightToBottomLeft(){
  for (let row = 0; row <= 2; row++) {
    for(let col = 0; col <= 3; col++){
      if(board[row][col] != 0 &&
         board[row][col] == board[row+1][col+1] &&
         board[row][col] == board[row+2][col+2] &&
         board[row][col] == board[row+3][col+3]){
           return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
function bottomRigthToUpperLeft(){
  for(let row = 3; row <= 5; row++){
    for(col = 0; col <= 3; col++){
      if(board[row][col] != 0 &&
         board[row][col] == board[row-1][col+1] &&
         board[row][col] == board[row-2][col+2] &&
         board[row][col] == board[row-3][col+3]){
           return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```
